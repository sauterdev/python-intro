# Python has functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

# open a file
myFile = open("myfile.txt", "w")

# get some info
print("Name:", myFile.name)
print("Is Closed:", myFile.closed)
print("Opening Mode:", myFile.mode)

# write to file
myFile.write("I love Python")
myFile.write(" and Javascript")
myFile.close()

# append to file
myFile = open("myfile.txt", "a")
myFile.write(" I also like CSS")
myFile.close()

# read from file
myFile = open("myfile.txt", "r+")
text = myFile.read(100)
